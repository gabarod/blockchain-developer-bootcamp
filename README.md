# Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 🚀🔗

Welcome to the Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp! This repository is a comprehensive guide designed to help you dive into the world of Ethereum blockchain development. 

## About the Project 📝

This bootcamp is a project-based learning experience, where you'll get hands-on experience with Ethereum blockchain technologies. The project is built with Solidity for smart contract development, Truffle for a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, and Chai for testing. The frontend is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Getting Started 🏁

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 

## Available Scripts 💻

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. We use Chai for testing.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- `npm run eject`: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Learn More 📚

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started). To learn React, check out the React documentation. For more information about Ethereum, Solidity, Truffle, and Chai, check out their official documentation.
